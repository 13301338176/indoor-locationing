# indoor-locationing
Indoor locationing using Wi-Fi fingerprints, machine learning, and deep learning.

Evaluated data and trained and tuned three models (random forest, k-NN, and neural network) in Python (Sci-kitlearn, Keras) to predict smartphone user locations in the UJIIndoorLoc indoor locationing dataset, achieving comparable results on the test set to those reported by teams who participated in the 2015 EvAAL-ETRI competition. The competition was a part of the 6th International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation.

The dataset is described in Torres-Sospedra et al. (2014) and the competition in Torres-Sospedrea et al. (2017).

Note: I did not attend the competition, but compared my results to theirs.
